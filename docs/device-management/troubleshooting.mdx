# Device Troubleshooting

This comprehensive guide addresses common issues that may arise with payment terminals and kiosk displays in your Khayr Technologies donation system. Follow these structured troubleshooting procedures to quickly diagnose and resolve problems.

## System Diagnostics

Before addressing specific issues, perform these general diagnostic steps:

### Dashboard Status Check

1. Sign in to your Khayr Technologies dashboard
2. Navigate to the "Devices" section
3. Review the status indicators for each device
4. Note any error messages or warning indicators

The dashboard provides real-time status information that can quickly identify disconnected devices or system alerts.

### Network Verification

1. Test internet connectivity on your organization's network
2. Verify Wi-Fi signal strength in device locations
3. Ensure network security settings allow device connections
4. Confirm no firewall restrictions are blocking device traffic

Most device issues stem from connectivity problems, making network verification an essential first step.

## Payment Terminal Issues

### Terminal Connection Problems

If a terminal shows as "Offline" or "Disconnected":

1. Verify the terminal is powered on with adequate battery charge
2. Ensure the terminal is within range of your Wi-Fi network
3. Check that the terminal displays a network connection indicator
4. Restart the terminal by holding the power button for 5 seconds
5. Verify the terminal is properly registered in your dashboard

For persistent connection issues:
1. Reset the terminal's network settings
2. Reconnect to your Wi-Fi network
3. Verify your router is functioning properly
4. Consider repositioning the terminal for better signal reception

### Payment Processing Failures

When payment attempts fail on the terminal:

1. Verify the terminal displays a connected status
2. Ensure the terminal software is updated to the latest version
3. Check that your Stripe account is active and in good standing

5. Verify the charging base is properly connected (for BBPOS WisePOS E)

Common resolution steps:
1. Perform a soft reset by restarting the terminal
2. Clear the terminal's transaction cache
3. Ensure adequate internet bandwidth for processing
4. Verify the terminal's date and time settings are correct

### Terminal Hardware Problems

For physical or hardware-related issues:

1. Inspect the terminal for visible damage
2. Check for loose connections or battery issues
3. Test the terminal on an alternative power source
4. Verify the card reader slot is clear of obstructions

If hardware problems persist:
1. Contact Stripe support for hardware replacement options
2. Document the specific issues and error messages
3. Prepare the terminal's serial number and purchase information
4. Follow Stripe's return merchandise authorization process

## Kiosk Display Issues

### Kiosk Connection Problems

If a kiosk shows as "Offline" or fails to connect:

1. Verify the device has power and is turned on
2. Ensure the kiosk is connected to your Wi-Fi network
3. Check that the Khayr application is running
4. Confirm the device meets minimum system requirements

For persistent connection issues:
1. Restart the kiosk application
2. Reboot the kiosk device
3. Reinstall the kiosk application
4. Reset the device's network settings

### Display and Interface Problems

When encountering visual or interaction issues:

1. Check screen brightness and visibility settings
2. Verify touch screen calibration and responsiveness
3. Ensure the application is running in the correct orientation
4. Check for physical damage to the display surface

Common resolution steps:
1. Clear the application cache in device settings
2. Update the kiosk application to the latest version
3. Restart the device to refresh system resources
4. Perform a factory reset if serious software issues persist

### Kiosk Software Problems

For application crashes or software malfunctions:

1. Check for available application updates
2. Verify adequate storage space on the device
3. Close background applications consuming resources
4. Check system logs for error messages

If software issues continue:
1. Uninstall and reinstall the kiosk application
2. Clear application data and cache
3. Update the device's operating system
4. Consider upgrading to a device with better specifications

## Integration Issues

### Kiosk-Terminal Communication Problems

When kiosks and terminals fail to communicate properly:

1. Verify both devices are online in your dashboard
2. Ensure devices are correctly paired in your configuration
3. Check that both devices are connected to the same network
4. Confirm both devices are running compatible software versions

Resolution steps:
1. Re-pair the devices in your dashboard
2. Restart both devices to refresh connections
3. Update both devices to the latest software versions
4. Test with simplified transactions to isolate issues

### Project Display Issues

When donation projects don't appear correctly:
