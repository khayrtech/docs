# Payment Terminals

The Khayr Technologies platform supports Stripe payment terminals to facilitate in-person donations at your organization. These terminals enable secure card payments at your location, providing donors with a convenient way to contribute.

## Supported Terminal Models

Khayr Technologies currently supports the following Stripe terminal hardware:

* **BBPOS WisePOS E**: Full-featured touchscreen payment terminal with integrated receipt printer

The BBPOS WisePOS E is recommended for permanent donation stations.

## Terminal Acquisition Process

Your order of a Donation Kiosk will come with a Terminal.

## Terminal Registration Process

After receiving your terminal hardware, register it with your Khayr account:

1. Power on the terminal and complete the initial setup screens

2. Access the "Devices" section in your Khayr dashboard

3. Select "Add Device" and choose "Add Terminal"

4. Enter the registration code displayed on the terminal screen

5. Provide a descriptive label for the terminal (e.g., "Main Entrance Terminal")

6. Click "Add Terminal" to complete the registration

The system will establish a connection with your terminal and prepare it for donation processing.

## Terminal Status Monitoring

Your dashboard displays terminal status information using the following indicators:

| Status  | Description                                              |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Online  | Terminal is connected and ready to accept payments       |
| Offline | Terminal is powered on but not connected to the internet |

You can view the status of all terminals from the Devices page in your dashboard.

## Physical Setup Recommendations

For an optimal donation station configuration:

### Security Considerations

* Mount terminals securely to prevent accidental damage or unauthorized removal

* Use cable management systems to protect power and network connections

* Position terminals within view of staff when possible

* Consider security cables for high-traffic areas

### Environmental Factors

* Ensure reliable power source to avoid battery depletion during operation

* Provide stable internet connectivity via Wi-Fi or Ethernet (where available)

* Position away from direct sunlight and heat sources

* Maintain appropriate operating temperature (41째F to 95째F / 5째C to 35째C)

### Accessibility Standards

* Mount at ADA-compliant height (typically 34-48 inches from floor)

* Ensure sufficient clear floor space for wheelchair access

* Position screen to minimize glare from overhead lighting

* Consider privacy screens in open areas

## Terminal Security Protocols

To maintain terminal security:

### Physical Security

* Regularly inspect terminals for signs of tampering

### Network Security

* Connect terminals only to secure, private networks

* Use WPA2 or higher encryption for wireless connections

* Change network credentials periodically

* Avoid public or unsecured Wi-Fi networks

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

If you encounter problems with your terminal:

### Connectivity Problems

1. Verify internet connectivity on your network

2. Restart the terminal using the power button

3. Ensure the terminal is within range of your Wi-Fi router

4. Check that your router is functioning properly

### Payment Processing Issues

1. Verify that the terminal is correctly registered in your dashboard

2. Ensure the terminal has the latest software updates

3. Check terminal battery level (for portable models)

4. Test with different payment cards if possible

### Hardware Malfunctions

1. Inspect for visible damage or loose connections

2. Perform a full power cycle (turn off, wait 30 seconds, turn on)

3. Return to factory settings if persistent issues occur

4. Contact support for hardware replacement if necessary

## Implementation Next Steps

After setting up your payment terminals:

1. [Configure a kiosk display](/docs/device-management/kiosks) to enhance the donation experience

2. [Create donation projects](/docs/donation-management/projects) for terminal display

3. [Process a test donation](/docs/device-management/troubleshooting#testing-donations) to verify functionality

4. [Review terminal analytics](/docs/donation-management/donations) to monitor performance
