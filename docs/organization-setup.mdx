# Organization Setup

Before accepting donations through the Khayr Technologies platform, you must configure your organization profile and connect payment processing services. This guide covers the essential steps required for initial account setup.

## Accessing Organization Settings

To begin configuring your organization profile:

1. Sign in to your Khayr Technologies dashboard at [dash.khayr.tech](https://dash.khayr.tech)
2. Navigate to the sidebar menu and select the **Organization** option
3. You will be directed to the organization settings interface featuring multiple configuration tabs

## Organization Profile Configuration

The Organization Details tab contains fields for your core organizational information:

### Essential Organization Information

The following information is required for platform functionality:

- **Organization Name**: The official name of your institution or non-profit
- **Tax ID**: Your organization's tax identification number (EIN) for tax-deductible donation receipts
- **Physical Address**: Your organization's primary location address
- **Organization Logo**: A square image representing your organization (recommended size: 150px Ã— 150px)

### Email Notification Settings

Configure how you receive donation notifications:

- **Enable Email Notifications**: Toggle to activate or deactivate email alerts
- **Notification Email**: The address where donation notifications will be sent
- **Notification Preferences**: Select which events trigger email notifications

## Payment Processing Integration

The Khayr platform requires a connected Stripe account to process donations:

### Stripe Account Connection

1. Navigate to the Organization settings page
2. Locate the "Stripe Account" section
3. Click the **Create Stripe Account** button
4. You will be redirected to Stripe to complete their account setup process
5. Provide the required business information:
   - Legal entity details
   - Banking information
   - Verification documentation

After completing the Stripe setup process, you will be redirected back to your Khayr dashboard with payment processing enabled.

### Verification Requirements

Stripe requires verification of your organization's:

- Legal status and business type
- Tax identification information
- Bank account details
- Authorized representative identity

This verification process ensures compliance with financial regulations and typically takes 1-2 business days to complete.

## Online Donation Configuration

To enable online donation functionality:

1. Access the **Online Donations** tab in Organization settings
2. Enable the "Online Donations" toggle
3. Create a custom URL slug for your organization (e.g., "masjid-al-noor")
4. Save your changes to generate your custom donation URL

Your organization will receive a dedicated online donation URL in this format:
```
https://khayr.tech/@your-organization-slug
```

Add additional administrative users to your organization:

1. Navigate to the **Organization Users** tab
2. Click the **Add User** button
3. Enter the email address for the new user
