# Payout Management

The Payouts section of your dashboard enables you to monitor and manage the transfer of donation funds from your processing account to your organization's bank account. This interface provides visibility into available balances, transfer history, and payout scheduling options.

## Understanding the Payout System

When a donation is processed through the Khayr Technologies platform, funds follow this path:

1. Donation payment is processed through Stripe

2. Funds enter your Stripe connected account balance

3. Funds become available for payout after a processing period

4. Payouts are transferred to your designated bank account

The Payouts dashboard provides complete transparency into this process and allows you to control when and how funds are transferred.

## Accessing Payout Management

To review and manage payouts:

1. Navigate to the **Payouts** option in the dashboard sidebar

2. The system displays your balance information and recent payout activity

3. The default view shows pending and completed payouts in chronological order

## Next Implementation Steps

After configuring your payout settings:

1. [Verify your bank account information](/docs/organization-setup)

2. [Set up financial reporting integration](/docs/donation-management/donations)

3. [Configure notification preferences](/docs/organization-setup)
