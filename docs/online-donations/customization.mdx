# Donation Page Customization

The Khayr Technologies platform allows you to customize the appearance and functionality of your online donation page to align with your organization's brand and fundraising objectives. This guide details the available customization options and implementation procedures.

## Visual Identity Components

Your donation page can be personalized through several visual elements:

### Organization Logo

The primary branding element appearing in the page header:

1. Navigate to the "Organization" section of your dashboard

2. Locate the "Organization Logo" upload interface

3. Upload a square image file (recommended size: 150px × 150px)

4. Preview the logo appearance

5. Save changes to update your donation page

A high-quality logo enhances brand recognition and donor confidence.

### Project Images

Images representing each fundraising initiative:

1. Access the "Projects" section of your dashboard

2. Select a project to edit

3. Locate the project image upload interface

4. Upload a high-quality rectangular image (recommended size: 800px × 400px)

5. Preview the image appearance

6. Save changes to update the project card

Compelling project images significantly impact donation conversion rates and should visually communicate your mission.

### Brand Colors

Color theme elements can be adjusted to match your organization's identity:

1. Navigate to the "Organization" section of your dashboard

2. Select the "Online Donations" tab

3. Locate the "Brand Colors" section

4. Select your primary and secondary colors using the color picker

5. Preview the appearance changes

6. Save your selected color scheme

Consistent color themes strengthen brand recognition and create visual cohesion.

## Donation Experience Customization

Beyond visual elements, you can customize the functional aspects of the donation experience:

### Project Organization

The arrangement of projects impacts donor attention and priority:

1. Access the "Projects" section of your dashboard

2. Use the drag-and-drop interface or directional arrows to reorder projects

3. Projects appearing first receive primary visibility

4. Save your preferred sequence

Strategic project ordering can emphasize seasonal or priority fundraising initiatives.

### Donation Amount Configuration

Customize the donation amounts presented to donors:

1. Edit each project individually

2. Configure preset donation amounts appropriate to the project

3. Set the default pre-selected amount

4. Enable or restrict custom amount options

5. Save your configuration

Thoughtfully selected amount options influence donor behavior and average contribution size.
