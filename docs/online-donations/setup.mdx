# Online Donation Setup

The Khayr Technologies platform includes a customizable online donation page that enables your supporters to contribute from any device with internet access. This guide explains how to configure and launch your organization's dedicated donation portal.

## Understanding Online Donation Capabilities

The online donation system provides several key capabilities:

1. A branded donation page unique to your organization
2. Project-based donation options that mirror your fundraising initiatives
3. Secure payment processing with receipting functionality
4. Support for both one-time and recurring donations
5. Mobile-optimized interfaces for all device types

## Prerequisites for Online Donations

Before activating your online donation page, ensure you have completed these foundational steps:

1. Configured your organization profile with complete information
2. Connected your Stripe payment processing account
3. Created at least one active donation project
4. Uploaded your organization logo for branding purposes

These components are required for a fully functional donation experience.

## Activating Online Donations

To enable your online donation page:

1. Sign in to your Khayr Technologies dashboard
2. Navigate to the "Organization" section in the sidebar
3. Select the "Online Donations" tab
4. Locate the "Enable Online Donations" toggle switch
5. Move the toggle to the "On" position
6. Create a custom URL slug (explained below)
7. Click "Save Changes" to activate your donation page

The system will generate your dedicated donation URL and make it publicly accessible.

## Creating Your Custom URL

Your organization's donation page will have a unique URL in this format:
```
https://khayr.tech/@your-organization-slug
```

When choosing your URL slug:

1. Select a concise, recognizable identifier (typically your organization name)
2. Use only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens
3. Avoid special characters or spaces
4. Keep it short and memorable for easy sharing

Example slugs:
- masjid-al-noor
- islamic-center-houston
- muslim-community-fund

Once created, this URL becomes your primary donation link for all online fundraising efforts.

## Donation Page Components

Your activated donation page automatically includes several key elements:

### Header Section

The page header displays:
- Your organization logo
- Organization name
- A rotating charitable quote from Islamic sources
- Navigation menu for multi-section donation pages

### Project Selection

The main content area showcases:
- Project cards with your configured donation projects
- Project images and descriptions
- Quick-selection donation buttons for common amounts

### Donation Form

The interactive donation form includes:
- Project selection capability

## Testing Your Donation Page

After activation, verify your donation page functionality:

6. Test on both desktop and mobile devices

Testing each aspect of the donation process ensures a seamless experience for your donors.
