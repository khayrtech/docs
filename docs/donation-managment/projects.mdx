# Managing Donation Projects

Donation projects provide the organizational structure for your fundraising efforts. By creating distinct projects, you enable donors to direct their contributions toward specific initiatives while allowing your organization to track and report on funding progress.

## Understanding Project Structure

In the Khayr Technologies platform, projects serve as the foundational units for donation collection. They define what appears on both your online donation page and physical kiosk displays, influencing how donors interact with your fundraising campaigns.

Each project consists of several key components:

- **Project Name**: The primary identifier displayed to donors
- **Description**: An explanation of the project's purpose and impact
- **Image**: Visual representation of the project or cause
- **Donation Configuration**: Settings that determine donation amount options
- **Display Position**: The order in which projects appear to donors

## Creating a New Project

To establish a new donation project:

1. Navigate to the **Projects** section in your dashboard
2. Select the **Add Project** button in the upper right corner
3. Complete the project creation form with your project details

### Required Project Information

When creating a project, you will need to provide:

- **Project Name**: Create a clear, concise name (recommended under 30 characters)
- **Description**: Craft a compelling explanation of the project's purpose
- **Project Image**: Upload a high-quality image (recommended size: 400px Ã— 200px)
- **Project Type**: Select either "Variable Amount" or "Fixed Price"

### Project Type Selection

The platform supports two distinct project types:

1. **Variable Amount**: Allows donors to select from preset amounts or enter custom values
2. **Fixed Price**: Establishes a specific per-unit cost (useful for item-based donations)

### Donation Amount Configuration

Configure how donation amounts are presented to donors:

- **Preset Amounts**: Define common donation values (e.g., $10, $25, $50, $100)
- **Default Amount**: Set the pre-selected amount shown initially to donors
- **Price Per Unit**: For fixed-price projects, establish the per-unit cost

## Managing Existing Projects

The Projects dashboard displays all your active projects with management options:

### Project Modification

To update an existing project:
1. Locate the project card in the dashboard
2. Click the **Edit Project** button
3. Modify any project details as needed
4. Save your changes

### Project Sequence

The display order of projects impacts donor visibility and emphasis:

1. Navigate to the Projects dashboard
2. Locate the project you wish to reposition
3. Use the directional arrows to move projects left or right in the sequence
4. Save your changes to preserve the new order

Projects appearing first in the sequence receive primary visibility on donation interfaces.

### Project Removal

To remove a project that is no longer relevant:
1. Locate the project in the dashboard
2. Click the delete icon on the project card
3. Confirm deletion when prompted

Note that project deletion permanently removes the project from your donation options but does not affect historical donation data associated with the project.

## Project Analytics

Each project includes basic performance metrics:

- Total donations received
- Number of individual contributions
- Average donation amount

For comprehensive project performance analysis:
1. Navigate to the **Donations** section
2. Apply project-specific filters
3. Review detailed transaction history and performance trends

## Implementation Best Practices

For optimal project management:

- Maintain clear, distinctive names for each project to avoid donor confusion
- Use high-quality, emotionally resonant images that represent the project's purpose
- Include a variety of preset donation amounts to accommodate different donor capacities
- Limit the number of active projects (5-7 is ideal) to prevent donor overwhelm
- Arrange projects strategically, placing priority initiatives early in the sequence
- Update project descriptions regularly to maintain accuracy and relevance
- Consider seasonal projects for special occasions like Ramadan or year-end giving

## Project Visibility

Projects appear in multiple interfaces throughout the donation ecosystem:

- On physical donation kiosks and terminals
- On your online donation page
- In email receipts and notifications
- In financial reports and analytics dashboards

When you update a project, changes propagate immediately to online interfaces and will refresh on physical kiosks at their next system update.

## Next Implementation Steps

After configuring your donation projects:

1. [Visit your online donation page](/docs/online-donations/setup) to verify project appearance
2. [Configure kiosk displays](/docs/device-management/kiosks) if using physical donation stations
3. [Review donation reports](/docs/donation-management/donations) to track project performance
