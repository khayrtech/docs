# Payout Management

The Payouts section of your dashboard enables you to monitor and manage the transfer of donation funds from your processing account to your organization's bank account. This interface provides visibility into available balances, transfer history, and payout scheduling options.

## Understanding the Payout System

When a donation is processed through the Khayr Technologies platform, funds follow this path:

1. Donation payment is processed through Stripe
2. Funds enter your Stripe connected account balance
3. Funds become available for payout after a processing period
4. Payouts are transferred to your designated bank account

The Payouts dashboard provides complete transparency into this process and allows you to control when and how funds are transferred.

## Accessing Payout Management

To review and manage payouts:

1. Navigate to the **Payouts** option in the dashboard sidebar
2. The system displays your balance information and recent payout activity
3. The default view shows pending and completed payouts in chronological order

## Key Dashboard Components

The Payouts dashboard consists of several primary elements:

### Balance Summary

The balance section displays your current financial status:

- **Available Balance**: Funds cleared and available for payout
- **Pending Balance**: Funds being processed but not yet available
- **Reserved Balance**: Funds held in reserve for potential refunds or disputes
- **Total Balance**: Combined funds across all categories

### Payout History

The transaction log shows all fund transfers:

- **Completed Payouts**: Successfully transferred funds
- **Pending Payouts**: Transfers initiated but not yet completed
- **Failed Payouts**: Transfers that encountered issues

### Scheduled Payouts

This section displays upcoming automatic payouts:

- **Next Payout Date**: When the next automatic transfer will occur
- **Estimated Amount**: Projected transfer amount
- **Payout Frequency**: Current automatic payout schedule

## Managing Payout Settings

The platform provides several options for controlling how funds are transferred:

### Payout Schedule Configuration

To establish your preferred payout frequency:

1. Navigate to the **Payout Settings** tab
2. Select your desired payout schedule:
   - Daily (fastest access to funds)
   - Weekly (balance accumulates for weekly transfer)
   - Monthly (single monthly transfer of accumulated funds)
3. If selecting weekly or monthly, specify preferred day
4. Save your schedule settings

### Payout Destination Management

To verify or update your payout destination:

1. Access the **Bank Accounts** tab
2. Review currently connected bank accounts
3. Add new accounts if desired
4. Designate a default account for receiving payouts
5. Remove unused accounts when necessary

### Manual Payout Initiation

For immediate transfer of available funds:

1. Verify your available balance
2. Select the **Initiate Payout** button
3. Confirm the payout amount
4. Select the destination account
5. Confirm the transfer

Note that manual payouts are subject to standard processing times (typically 1-2 business days).

## Understanding Payout Timeframes

Several factors influence when funds become available for payout:

### Standard Availability Timeline

- **Card payments**: Generally available in 2 business days
- **Instant payments**: Available same day but may incur additional fees
- **International cards**: May require additional processing time

### Payout Processing Times

Once initiated, payouts typically process according to this schedule:

- **ACH transfers**: 1-2 business days

- **International transfers**: 3-5 business days

## Managing Payout Issues

If a payout fails or encounters problems:

### Common Payout Complications

- **Bank account verification issues**: Missing or incorrect account information

### Resolution Process

1. Review the failure notification for specific error details
2. Navigate to the affected payout in the dashboard
3. Select the **Resolve** option
4. Follow the guided resolution steps
5. Reinitiate the payout when the issue is corrected
